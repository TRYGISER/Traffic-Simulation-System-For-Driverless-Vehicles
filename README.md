# Traffic-Simulation-System-For-Driverless-Vehicles
To create a simulation of the deployment of driverless vehicles in modern day society. This will demonstrate the projected evolution of the introduction of such a vehicles deployment onto modern roads whilst measuring the sum of collisions and road deaths over time. The Platform proposed will import real maps from around the globe and populate them with virtual simulations of vehicles, driverless vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians to observe how they interact with one another. The platform will build the virtual driverless vehicles as close to the current real-world driverless vehicles which exist today by creating the dimensions and sensors of the vehicle and their associated behaviour.
